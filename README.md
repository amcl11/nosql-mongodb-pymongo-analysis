# Module 12: Restaurant Analysis
## NoSQL / MongoDB / PyMongo / Pandas

### Project Description: 

Using MongoDB and PyMongo to perform data cleaning and analysis on UK Food Establishments data. 

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this hypothetical analysis, we have been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.  <br>
<br>

### Resources:
UK Food Establishments data is located in the ["Resources"](https://github.com/amcl11/nosql-challenge/tree/main/Resources) directory. File is "establishments.json"  <br>
